# my very own assembly and CPU Interpreter
this is my first bigger C projects so please be kind to me


## Assembler

the assembler is really simple and the pipeline is like this:
```
code.asm -> tokenize lines into array -> remove comments from every line -> tokenize every line of the array and create matrix by that -> translating it into machine code (TODO) -> code.o
```

## Interpreter
I haven't started working on this yet
